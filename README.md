# SecureAuth
The SecureAuth smart contract aims to provide a multi-factor authentication (MFA) system for enhanced security in contract interactions. It integrates various MFA methods such as biometrics, SMS-based verification, and hardware tokens to create an additional layer of authentication.

Features:

    User Registration: Users can register their accounts with the contract and associate their MFA credentials, such as biometric data, phone numbers, or hardware token IDs.

    Biometric Verification: Users can authenticate themselves using biometric data, such as fingerprints or facial recognition, to validate their identity.

    SMS-based Verification: Users can request an SMS verification code sent to their registered phone numbers. They need to enter the correct code to complete the authentication process.

    Hardware Token Verification: Users can use their hardware tokens, such as USB security keys or smart cards, to authenticate themselves and gain access to contract interactions.

    Access Control: The contract enforces access control, allowing only authenticated users with the appropriate MFA credentials to perform specific actions or access certain contract functionalities.

    Event Logging: The contract logs authentication events and important actions, providing an audit trail for security monitoring and analysis.

The SecureAuth script enhances the security of smart contract interactions by implementing multiple layers of authentication, reducing the risk of unauthorized access and ensuring the integrity of the system.
