# SecureAuthPlus Manual

## Overview
SecureAuthPlus is a smart contract that provides multi-factor authentication (MFA) functionality for enhanced security. It allows users to register their accounts and authenticate using various MFA methods such as biometric verification, SMS-based verification, and hardware token verification.

## Getting Started
To use SecureAuthPlus, follow these steps:

1. Deploy the SecureAuthPlus contract to the desired blockchain network.
2. Register user accounts by calling the `registerUser` function and providing the necessary information and MFA credentials.
3. Use the provided MFA methods to authenticate users, such as `authenticateBiometric`, `authenticateSMS`, or `authenticateHardwareToken`.
4. Once authenticated, users can access specific contract functionalities and perform authorized actions.
5. Monitor the event logs emitted by the contract for authentication events and important actions.

## Functions
SecureAuthPlus provides the following functions:

- `registerUser`: Registers a user account with the associated MFA credentials.
- `authenticateBiometric`: Authenticates a user using biometric verification.
- `authenticateSMS`: Sends an SMS verification code to the user's registered phone number and verifies the entered code.
- `authenticateHardwareToken`: Authenticates a user using a hardware token.
- `hasPermission`: Checks if a user has a specific permission level for a given action.
- `revokeAllPermissions`: Revokes all permissions from a user, resetting their access rights.

Please refer to the contract's source code and inline documentation for more details on each function.

## Security Considerations
- Store MFA credentials securely and encrypt any sensitive user information.
- Regularly update the contract to incorporate the latest security best practices and address any identified vulnerabilities.
- Perform thorough testing, including security audits, before deploying the contract to a production environment.

For more information, refer to the SecureAuthPlus documentation and the provided README file.
